# My Portfolio

The Python programming language is highly developed, both culturally and technically.
Python developers often call themselves Pythonistas.

The Python language even has its own philosophy: the Zen of Python. With versatile use cases 
across various industries, Python developers are in high demand.

So, to join the ranks of Python developers and become a Pythonista myself, I've decided to
put together and experiment with a series of mini projects written in the Python language.

This portfolio (ironically, also written mostly in Python) will act as the channel by
which I can demonstrate everything I create. Hopefully you enjoy!
